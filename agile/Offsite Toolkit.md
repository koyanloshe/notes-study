————————————————————————————————————————————————————
|  **Phase** | **Descriptors** | **Guidance** |
|-----|-----|-----|
|  **Forming** | •	Goals, roles, and processes are ill-defined
	•	Reliance on the manager to direct
	•	Little psychological safety, so not much risk taking or confrontationÂ 
	•	Overt politeness / agreement | •	Expect to be more directive
	•	Expect and work with silence in response to questions
	•	Provide extra support, direction, and modeling in activities
	•	Actively work to build psych safety by setting up collaborative/supportive team norms |
|  **Storming** | •	Boundaries around goals, roles, and processes still not 100% // toe-stepping
	•	Increased psych safety allows conflict to emergeÂ | •	Frame the conflict as a healthy step // donâ€™t try to squelch it; work with it
	•	Work toward cleaning up the goals, roles, and processes
	•	Share this theory to help teams understand that itâ€™s normal (and that every member is part of the progression) |
|  **Norming** | •	Goals, roles, and processes are clearer
	•	The manager begins to become more consultative
	•	Increased commitment and collaboration
	•	Decision making is cleaner | •	Celebrate getting through storming
	•	Continue to hone how the team gets work done
	•	With the team getting in stride, continue the urgency and focus toward the goal |
|  **Performing** | •	The team is in flow
	•	Healthy debate and decision making
	•	Smooth conflict resolution | •	Continue to button up norms
	•	Continue to increase the rate of challenge
	•	Know that this phase is not permanent // change is most likely just around the corner |

## Facilitator Guide

You've just been chosen to facilitate a session, now what? Here are some ideas to help support you as a facilitator.

**## Get clear on your session objectives and â€œthe whyâ€
**
* What are you going to accomplish in this session?
* Why is this session important for the team/task/goal?Â 
* What activities / discussions are going to support the goals of the session? Â 

**## Prep for where the team is
**
* This goes back to the group phase of development. For example, if your team is forming, youÂ *know*Â you you can most likely expect silence in response to questions. Â Plan for it: consider how youâ€™ll set up discussions to prompt participation, prep yourself for awkward silences, consider examples you might give to get conversation going, provide pre-reads...
* On that note, weâ€™ve started compiling team ice breaker / getting-to-know-you session ideas, see appendix.Â 

**## If your session includes making decisions, consider the processÂ 
**
* Consider how will you work from discussion to decisions; this is a perennial challenge for many facilitators, as the seduction of consensus can be strong.Â 
* Consider a divergent/convergent model. In the divergent phase of conversation, itâ€™s all about generating ideas and open dialogue. As the discussion or ideation continues, begin pulling together themes and moving more toward a â€œconvergentâ€ synthesis of ideas. Taking those themes forward, be clear with next steps in the final decision (e.g., maybe a small work group partners with the DRI to finalize outside of the session).
	* Stanfordâ€™s D schoolÂ _offers helpful brainstorming rules_Â (look past the ridiculousness of the video and focus on the rules)
	* AÂ _â€œstop, start, continueâ€_Â exercise can be helpful as well to generate ideas and then chunk the ideas into categories

**## Use reflection-in-action
**
* Assume that your best-laid plan will have surprises. Rather than trying to force what you had planned in your mind or on paper, work with whatâ€™s happening in the room. For example, if a productive conversation is at play, donâ€™t shut it down for the sake of the time boundary youâ€™ve created for it. We recommend putting time buffers into your agenda to account for the unknown.
* Continue to actively reflect upon your role in the group and how effectively youâ€™re conveying information, encouraging participation, creating psych safetyâ€¦
* If youâ€™re teaching something, keep in mind that you teaching does not mean anyone is learning (painful, right?). Learning happens at the individual level, so check in for understanding and any need for clarity along the way.

**## BART is your friendÂ 
**
Use the Boundaries, Authority, Role, Task (**BART**) framework to support your planning and reflection-in-action
* **Boundaries**
	* What are the ultimate time boundaries for your session?Â 
	* What are the physical boundaries of the space youâ€™ll be in; how might the space affect participation? Whatâ€™s the right room setup for what youâ€™ll be doing?Â 
	* What are the boundaries of the group? Whatâ€™s discussable vs. undiscussable (hanging in the air but unsaid)? How might you make the undiscussable discussable in a safe way?Â 
* **Authority**
	* How effectively are you giving yourself authority (confidence) to lead the session?Â 
	* Who will be authorized to support decision making?Â 
	* Who in the room is authorized to do what?Â 
* **Role**
	* What implicit role might you be taking up, and is it serving the group and task?
	* What implicit roles are others taking up (e.g., cheerleader, class clown, devilâ€™s advocate)? How are these roles serving or detracting from the task, and how can you work with them?Â 
* **Task**
	* What is the task youâ€™re trying to accomplish in the session?Â 
	* How ready is the team to work against the task?Â 
	* How able is the group to focus on the task vs. fall into an avoidance of it? Â 

**## Own it
**
* If youâ€™re in a large room, feel free to use the space; facilitate from different parts of the room to create dynamism.
* If you feel your nerves come on; project your voice. It can imbue a sense of confidence and get you through the nervousness (faking confidence does wonders - seriously).
* Donâ€™t give your power over to slides or docs; theyâ€™re there to help you but should only have key information or snippets. Think of them as a complement.
* Practice beforehand.
* Use the 5 Ps of public speaking: pitch, power, pause, pace, and (once again) practice
	* Know your environment. Be crystal clear on what the offsite location will have (e.g., whiteboards, projectors) and what you need to bring. Â Here is a checklist you may want to use:Â 
	* Large white post it paper
	* Small post its
	* Sharpies, pens, markers
	* Clicker
	* Projection cables and dongles
	* Chargers
	* Any print outs
	* Tape
	* Speaker (tunes are a great way to get energy going)

## Icebreaker Ideas

Obviously there's no shortage of icebreaker exercises to be found on the internet. Here are a few of my go-tos.**
**

**# List of Icebreakers
**
|  **Activity name** | **How long does it take?** | **How does it work?** | **Anything else?** |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|  **Is - Is Not - Does - Does Not** | 20 mins | Divide a flipchart into 4 quadrants, labelling each quadrant with one of the following titles: Is, Is Not, Does, Does Not. Ask the team members to describe the team on post-its (one idea per post-it) and put them in the corresponding quadrants. Group similar descriptions and discuss each quadrant as a group. | This activity helps the team to build a consensus on how they define the team. |
|  **SWOT Analysis** | 25 mins | 4 quadrants: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats. Everyone in the group has a different colour post-it pad. They then have to think about how to answer for the following questions for them as individuals: 1. Strengths â€“ â€œwrite down what you feel you do well and can help the teamâ€ 2. Weaknesses â€“ â€œwhat are the things that you could improve?â€ After these 2 sections, read out the post-its on the board and discuss as a group. Then ask them to do the same for the other 2 quadrants. 3. Opportunities â€“ â€œgiven the teamâ€™s strengths, what can you capitalize on and take as a lead to be successful?â€ 4. Threats â€“ â€œwith those weaknesses, what are the obstacles you will have to overcome?â€ Again read out the answers and discuss as a group. | We often do SWOT for the team as a whole, but this allows everyone to get to know people on an individual level. It also allows team members to contribute to other's strengths which they hadn't thought of before! |
|  **Human Knot** | 10 mins | Standing in a circle, participants must hold hands with 2 others from the group. As a team, they must then unravel the knot without breaking the chain of hands. | This is a quick and fun exercise that builds team camaraderie and works as an energiser. Clear instructions required at outset! |
|  **1,2,3 Game** | 10 mins | Instructor and volunteer start off. Instructor says 1, volunteer says 2, instructor says 3, volunteer says 1, instructor says 2 and repeat until the team gets the idea. Then have the group divide into pairs and do the same for 1 minute. Now the instructor and volunteer do the same again, but this time instead of '1', you clap your hands. Once demonstrated, have the group do the exercise for 1 minute. Now the instructor and volunteer do the same again, but this time, continue with '1' as a clap, and add a click of the fingers instead of '2'. Once demonstrated, have the group do the exercise for 1 minute. Now the instructor and volunteer do the same again, but this time, continue with '1' as a clap, a click of the fingers instead of '2', and add a slap of your knee (or whatever you'd prefer!) for '3'. Once demonstrated, have the group do the exercise for 1 minute. Now have the team simply repeat the exericse, but this time count '1,2, 3' again i.e. no actions. The goal here is to show that while the simple 1, 2, 3 was difficult at the beginning, it gets much easier as you move on to try harder things. Also the bond and rhythm between the pairs improves the ability to do the exercise. | This is an exercise for high performance and works as an energiser and team building activity. |
|  **Journey Lines** | 1 hr | Team members share the high and low moments of their lives and the values that have come to be important along the way. Draw a line down the middle of a piece of paper and plot high moments above the line, low moments below. Only share what you feel comfortable sharing. Modeling the exercise first is important to set the tone for vulnerability, then provide 10-15 minutes for folks to draw their own journey line. Split the team into groups of 4-6, and provide ~7 minutes for each person to share. | A somewhat abbreviated version is here: http://toolbox.hyperisland.com/telling-our-stories |
|  **Values Discussion** | 30 mins | Each member of the team chooses 1 value they want the team to uphold and provides a story from their lives to describe why that value is important (e.g., a previous team or life experience). The team then collects the values, discusses themes and how they're currently present or need some work, and revisits them for discussion and evaluation, over time. (more suited for smaller teams) | 
 |
|  **Photo Sharing** | 30 mins | Select a personal photo that has an important meaning or represents an aspect of your personality that is important to you. You can bring in a physical copy or share a digital version on your phone. | Alternate version: Everyone brings in a baby photo. Tape photos to the wall and number each photo. Each person gets a piece of paper and writes down their guesses for who's who (#1 - Marissa). At the end, reveal the identities then everyone goes around and shares a fun/meaningful/interesting story from their childhood. |

# Something about scrum

Great teams need great Practices + People + Tools

## What is scrum?

Scrum is about shipping value continuously to customers. It has more to do about doing than thinking. 
Agile is a philosophy. It has to do more about thinking than doing 

In a Scrum, projects are built in sprints. Sprints prevent problems faced in waterfall projects. 

Embraces change as it changes mindset and work process, reduce risks and costs and u see valley quicker, is regular and tangible process - prevent burnout. 

## How does it work?

Backlog grooming is important. Where u decide what pieces are half baked and what pieces are actionable & hence usable during sprint planning
Product backlog is what is the list of requirements, enhancements, fixes to be worked on. What will be worked on in the next sprint needs to be decided. On an average sprints are 2 weeks long. Key ceremonies are- 
1. Sprint planning - move task stories from backlog to sprint keeping in mind what can be done in 2 weeks. 
2. Daily scrum - voice opinions/ concerns/ blocker & last for about 15 minutes. Get everyone on the same page. 
3. Sprint reviews - team showcases what is done. A demo of the accomplished to the product owner. And then rework backlog. This acts as input for next sprint. 
4. Sprint retrospectives - what went right. What went wrong. What needs to be improved for next time. 

## Roles in scrum

Remember the prime directive:
Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand. 

Leave phones & laptops outside.

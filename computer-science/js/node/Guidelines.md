In general, I try to go through the following list and check off if the site could be doing better on one or more of them:
✂️ Send less JavaScript (code-splitting)

🗜 Compress diligently! (GZip, Brotli)
📦 Cache effectively (HTTP, Service Workers)
⚡️ Minify & optimize everything
🗼 Preresolve DNS for critical origins 
💨 Preload critical resources
📲 Respect data plans
🌊 Stream HTML responses
📡 Make fewer HTTP requests
📰 Have a Web Font loading strategy
🛣 Route-based chunking
📒 Library sharding
📱 PRPL pattern
🌴 Tree-shaking (Webpack, RollUp)
🍽 Serve modern browsers ES2015 (babel-preset-env)
🏋️‍♀️ Scope hoisting (Webpack)
🔧 Don’t ship DEV code to PROD

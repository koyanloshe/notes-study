# Fundamentals 

## 

## Principles of RESTful APIs

1. Everything is a resource
2. Each resource is identifiable by a unique identifier (URI)
3. Resources are manipulated via standard HTTP methods
4. Resources can have multiple representations
5. Communicate with resources in a stateless manner

GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE/CONNECT

## Goals of REST

1. Separation of the representation and the resource
2. Visibility
3. Reliability
4. Scalability
5. Performance

# Mail to Kotak folks

Hi,

Two topics being addressed in this email.
1. The ongoing UX project for the new website
2. A new drag-n-drop email generation system

The ongoing design project for the new website
As we know, the initial idea was to create about 15 or so templates for the new website for Kotak. 

There have been a lot of changes in the initial scope after internal conversations as more people stepped into the project.

Hitesh & I have spent the past many weeks plotting user journeys, deciding rough content blocks, putting a navigation system in place and more. We devised a (some-what) future proof way to assemble the website with Cartesian, Notify and others in mind.

Then, we had to take fresh inputs from several teams. We are still expecting some teams to give us more inputs. 

We have added a lot of work to the scope that wasn’t there initially. From just designing templates, we have moved to making a complete web solution. It’s good fun and challenging but also time consuming.

Deliverables:
* We need to design many more pages as needed for the pre-login section AND the post-login section to ensure clear communication with the dev team. 
* We need to plot a new user journey to ensure we don’t miss anything. We need to keep the 3-step to anything approach in mind while doing so.
* We need to create a whole other section around “My Account”/“My Profile” to manage the Nil, •, #, 0, 1st, 2nd’s data. A place where the user can view and update his information and history. 
* We need to create a deeper version of the initially scoped Research and Markets section that incorporates over 500 data points.
* We need to create relevant illustrations on pages. The open license graphics are not extendable to all our use cases.
* We need to add a developer section to the Design System and add more components there as we make them. Also need to make the design system showcase-able.

We have also roped in Sandhya for her content inputs so that we can have a more complete picture in the design phase.

The commercials for this extended project are ₹ 2.5 Lacs. I will dedicate 4 days of my time every week to just this work. I too want to see an engaging and ideally-fit product going out the door.

The commercials I have stated here presume work will complete before the end of March (including the finishing touches and assets handover). If things take longer, we will need to assess things in April once again.

A new drag-n-drop email generation system
Kotak sends more than 50 styles of emails a month. The idea is to make easier the email design and development process that is presently followed at Kotak. Hitesh & I have identified commonalities in these emailers Kotak sends and have designed a super-emailer (so to say) that comprises all the blocks that are used in them. 

The next task is to create an easy way for the mail-sending team to assemble these emails and ship them via Netcore. A drag-n-drop assembler is the simplest way to proceed. Blocks will be readily available in the system for drag and drop assembly. Clicking on the text will make it editable. Clicking on a button will allow image addition/replacement. Even adding a link to a button will be a click away. The design will be such that non technical users will be able to assemble the mailer. They will be allowed to export a zip of the package they have made which can then be uploaded to Netcore.

These blocks once coded will to be truly responsive across essential mail clients like Gmail Web, Android and iOS, the content within them will be editable and the overall package will be light for mobile delivery.

Please note that graphics will still need to made by a designer. That will not be automated by this system.

For the first run, we are making the system for PCG. It will also then be extended to all Kotak Securities mailers as a part of this project.

Once a system is created for email, and users adopt it with ease, we can then build a similar system for landing pages in the time to come.

There will need to be a backend to power this technology. I will be writing the system in JavaScript and consuming free APIs which will help in file compression.

Deliverables:
1. A hosted system
2. Designed responsive blocks
3. Development of said responsive blocks
4. Making the drag and drop system
5. Creating the CMS needed to manage files and templates in the backend to facilitate the export of the Zip downloadable.
6. A database to store creations to make them available for reuse. (optional)
7. A lot of manual testing
This project has a rather large scope even though it may not appear so initially. Took me a few days to accept that

The commercials estimated for this project are ₹ 3.5 Lacs. 

Payment terms will be 50% in advance and 50% on completion for this project.

Please let me know your thoughts.

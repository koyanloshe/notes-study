# Relational Data Model

* Tables
* Tuples
* Relation instance
* Relation schema
* Relation Key
* Attribute Domain

## Relational integrity Constraints

Every relation has some conditions that must hold for it to be valid relation. Three main integrity constraints
1. Key constraint,
2. Domain constraint,
3. Referential integrity constraint

**Key constraint**

Key constraints force that âˆ’
* in a relation with a key attribute, no two tuples can have identical values for key attributes.
* a key attribute can not have NULL values.

**Domain constraint**
Attributes have specific values in real-world scenario. Every attribute is bound to have a specific range of values

**Referential integrity constraint**
They work on the concept of foreign keys. It is a key attribute of a relation that can be referred in other relation.

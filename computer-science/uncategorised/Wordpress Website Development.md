## Even More WordPress Plug-Ins

In this chapter, you considered several of the most useful Word-Press plug-ins. However, in a directory of thousands, it’s no surprise that there are many more worth considering.
You’ll learn about some of these plug-ins in the following chapters (and some you’ll need to discover on your own). Here’s a list of some of the most popular:
• Akismet.Thisspam-fightingtoolistheonlyplug-inthat ships preinstalled (but not activatd) with WordPress. You learned about it in Chapter 8.
• WordPress SEO by Yoast. Search-engine optimization (SEO) is the art of attracting the attention of web search engines like Google, so you can lure new visitors to your site. SEO plug-ins are among the most popular in the WordPress plug-in directory, and WordPress SEO by Yoast is an all-in-one package by one of the most renown developers in the WordPress community. You’ll take a closer look at it on page 441.
•Word Press Importer. Moving your WordPress site from one web host to another? The WordPress Importer handles the job with relatively few speed bumps. (In Appendix A, “Migrating from WordPress.com,” you’ll use WordPress Importer to migrate from WordPress.com to a self-hosted site.) Automattic developed WordPress Importer.
•Tiny MCE Advanced. You learned about this slick editor, suitable for beefing up your post-writing powers, on page 179.
•WooCommerce. If you want to sell products on your site, complete with a professional shopping cart and checkout process, this could be the plug-in for you. Although you won’t use it in this book, you’ll try out a simpler shopping cart plug-in on page 545.
• BuddyPress. If your website is bringing together a tightly knit community—for example, the students of a school, the employees of a business, or the members of a sports team, you can use BuddyPress to add instant social networking features to your site. Users get profiles, the ability to message one another, add photos, create content, and talk together in groups. To learn more, visit http://buddypress.org.
• WP-Optimize. This tool cleans up the junk that’s often left cluttering your database. It can remove unapproved junk comments (page 282), old post revisions (page 387), and other unnecessary data that can expand the size of your database, slowing down your site and bloating your backups.
• Limit Login Attempts.This plug-in helps defend your site against hackers who use brute-force password-guessing attacks. You’ll learn more on page 567.

The most popular podcasting plug-in for self- hosted WordPress sites is Blubrry PowerPress (http://tinyurl.com/wp-podcast).

Use your favorite email program or get the Email Users plug-in (http://tinyurl.com/emailusers), which lets you send a mass email to all your users at once. This plug-in is a big help if you don’t have their email addresses handy

However, if you run a self-hosted site and want to implement a better system, there’s a plug-in that can change everything. It’s called Edit Flow (http://tinyurl.com/editflow) and it adds the structure you need to manage a multistage review process

To create true co-authored posts, you need to take two steps. First, you need to add the Co-Authors Plus plug-in (http:// tinyurl.com/co-authors-plus), which lets you designate mul- tiple authors for any post or page. Second—and this is the hard part—you have to get your posts and pages to actually display the names of the authors who worked on them. To make that possible, you need to edit your theme, as the Co-Authors Plus plug-in explains (see http://tinyurl.com/ccr7896).

Self-hosters can get a plug-in that offers the same features at http://tinyurl.com/ wp-polls. However, it’s a bit finicky, and it forces you to sign up for a free Polldaddy account.)

One example is the popular Subscribe2 plug-in (http://tinyurl. com/wp-sub2).

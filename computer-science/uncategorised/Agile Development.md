# Agile Development

* Analysis
* Requirements Specifications
* Design
* Implementation
* Testing & Integration
* Operations & Maintenance

**Analysis** - Changing requirements affect the deadline
**Requirements - Design - Implementation** - People pinching delays progress
**Testing & Integration** - Defects found too late

* Make some ROI
* Discover potential issues early
* Change requirements often
* React to change through replanning
* Lightweight solutions.

## The Agile Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value
Individual interactions — Processes and tools
Working Software — Comprehensive documentation
Customer Collaboration — Contract negotiation
Responding to change — following a plan

**Ken Schwaber & Jeff Sutherland define Scrum as Framework for developing and sustaining complex products**

Iterative & Incremental

Consists of 3 Principles
1. Transparency (done means done)
2. Inspection (check on progress)
3. Adaptation (change the product based on inspection)

## Scrum skeleton

Sprint Planning
Daily Scrum
Sprint Review
Sprint Retrospective

## Rules

Team should follow a common definition of done. They need to be transparent and honest
Define frequency of inspection. Set the sprint length ahead of time.

## Team Roles

* Scrum master
* Product owner
* Development team

## Scrum Master

* Expert on Scrum rules
* Remove team impediments/blockers
* Help the team to self organise
* Facilitate meetings or wherever necessary
* Helps the product owner maximise ROI
* Helps the team to be productive

## Product Owner

* **Responsible for creating the product backlog. He is accountable.**
* Prioritise requirements based on business value
* Make decisions to maximise ROI
* Make trade offs to maximise product value

## Team

* Build potentially shippable product increment
* Dev team is one of the 3 scrum team roles
* Self organising & collaborative
* Multi-skilled as needed for the product
* Experts in their field - Scrum master on timeline and Product owner on direction
* Optimum team size (Between 5 & 9)

Definition of done as a scrum team as to what output of each sprint is classifiable as a useful increment of product

Responsible => You are doing the task - Have you done the task? Did you do it right
Accountable => You still instruct or delegate the task. Why something didn’t get done.
Time Box => Events

* A sprint meet is 4 hours meeting for a two week sprint
* 2 halves “the what” and “the how”
* Proposed feature list then tasks and sub tasks
* Daily scrum/ Standup - where u answer what u did yesterday, what u aim to do today, are there any blockers?
* Sprint review - Product owner is given a product demo at the end of sprint and stakeholders are asked for feedback
* Sprint retrospective - did the sprint work and what can be improved in the next sprint?
* Release planning meeting - product backlog and release backlog (subset of product backlog) - team velocity is determined in this section

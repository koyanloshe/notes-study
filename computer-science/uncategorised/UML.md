# UML 

## UML building blocks

* Things
* Relationships
* Diagrams

————————————————————————————————————————
————————————————————————————————————————

## Things

* Structural 
* Behavioural
* Grouping
* Annotational

————————————————————————————————————————
## Structural Things

|  Class | Set of objects having similar responsibilities |
|-----|-----|
|  Interface | Set of operations which specify responsibility of a class |
|  Collaboration | Defines interaction between elements |
|  Use case | Set of actions performed by a system for a specific goal |
|  Component | Physical parts of a system |
|  Node | Physical element that exists at run time |

## Behavioural things

|  Interaction | Group of messages exchanged among elements to accomplish a task |
|-----|-----|
|  State machine | defines the sequence of states an objects goes through in response to events. |

## Grouping things

|  Package | Is the only one grouping thing available for gathering structural & behavioural things |
|-----|-----|

## Annotational things

|  Note | Is the only annotational thing available. It is used to render comments, constraints, etc of a UML element. |
|-----|-----|

## Relationships

|  Dependency | relationship between 2 things in which change in one element also affects the other |
|-----|-----|
|  Association | Set of links that connect elements of a UML |
|  Generalization | A relationship which connects a specialised element with a generalised element. |
|  Realization | One element describes some responsibility which is not implemented and the other one implements the. |

UML has 9 diagrams

**Structural models**

1. Class diagram
2. Object diagram
3. Deployment diagram
4. Package diagram
5. Composite structure diagram
6. Component diagram

**Behavioural models**

1. Use case diagram
2. Activity diagram
3. Interaction diagram

1. Sequence diagram
2. Collaboration diagram
3. State chart diagram

UML plays a key role in 
* Design
* Implementation
* Process
* Deployment

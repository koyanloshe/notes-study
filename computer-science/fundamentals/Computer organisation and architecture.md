Structure and functions are two aspects of a system. 

1. Structure is the way components are Related to each other
2. Function us the operation off individual components as a part of the structure. 

Two options of either start at both and build up or start at top and decompose to the sub parts. 
Top down approach is most effective. 

Function can be:
1. Data processing - there are only a few types of processing. 
2. Data storage- even if data is processed on the fly, data must be temporarily stored- short term data storage. Files are stored on computer for subsequent retrieval and update - long term data storage. 
3. Data movement - data is received or delivered to devices connected directly to the computer it is called io and the devices are called peripherals. If the same communication happens over a long distance it is called data communications
4. Control - control unit manages a computerâ€™s resources and orchestrates the performance of its functional parts based in instructions. 

Structure can be:

Employ anticipatory design ie. output with minimal input. Provide cues that are aligned to user expectations that promote business interests

Identify your competitors and evaluate their strategies to determine their strengths and weaknesses relative to those of your own product or service. Defining what is being done and what can be done and choosing what needs to be done.

Create user personas to encapsulate and communicate behaviour patterns. This provides the right lens for the situation.

Navigation, find ability and usability are the factors to be considered when charting the information flow

User flows need to be charted exploring the possible routes a user will take around the website in search of certain information.

Wireframes have been extended to what are now called wireflows. The intention of these charts is to understand the interactivity foreseen while creating a wire framing. It also checks for completeness of a certain design by keeping trac of input variables in a tabulation as suggested in the below link

Click to view and experience - type of prototypes can be designed to emulate the experience the user will have on product moving to production. These interactive mocks allow business to plug failure points before the problems percolate into production and make themselves evident before real users and affect the brand.

Creating interesting responses to stimuli qualifies as interaction design.

Specifications of font dimensions and style related details can be tabulated for the reference of developers. That ensures perfect translation of design to code.

Client expectations are along the below lines

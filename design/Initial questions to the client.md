# Initial questions to the client

■ what does the company do?
■ What is your role in the company?
■ Does the company have an existing logo or brand? What is your goal in developing a website?
■ What information do you wish to provide online?
■ Who comprises your target audience? Do its members share any common demographics, like
age, sex, or a physical location?
■ Who are your competitors and do they have websites?
■ Do you have examples of websites you like or dislike?
■ What kind of timeline do you have for the project and what is the budget?
If the project is to redesign an existing website, I also like to ask:
■ What are your visitors usually looking for when they come to your site?
■ What are the problems with your current design?
■ What do you hope to achieve with a redesign?
■ Are there any elements of the current site that you want to keep?
■ How do you think your visitors will react to a new site design?

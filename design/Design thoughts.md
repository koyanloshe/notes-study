# Design thoughts

**what** the problem is, 
**why** it exists, 
and **how** to solve it.

**The why** is infinitely more difficult to figure out because of **our reliance on common knowledge and intuition** when looking for an answer. To figure out **the why,** a designer must exercise deliberate thinking to distill the problem to one indisputable fact — **the foundation or the first principle.** Not *“what is the problem?”* but *“****why**** is the problem?”* A great designer must make it her starting point because the answer to that question will inform **the how** of solving a design problem. **The how** is where technical skills are most important and being a generalist puts one at a massive advantage. Myriad of ways to solve any given problem exist but only one may be optimal — the one that eliminates it altogether.

## Informed Consent.

ELEMENT START : span
## If there is a need to improve a brief, decide a few possible options that can be employed and with due consent of the person giving the brief, proceed in implementing those improvements. Without consent, change is by definition a rebellion.

## Going on a tangent vs doing something new - what is the actual difference?

Client’s brand> client’s brief > copywriters brief> desire to do something new. In this order, after you have evaluated your idea to deviate from the normal, you may seek informed consent and then proceed in implementing your thoughts.

## Bash out what you have made with the copywriter & only the copywriter.

Opinions need to be taken from the copywriter and only the copywriter. An account manager can weigh in if and only if the client’s brand is not being followed. The need for an account manager to intervene is an insult to both the copywriter and the designer, as this means there are 2 people making a mistake and not just 1.

## Dispute settlement can and will be done by the Art Director.

If copywriter and designer are at loggerheads, the creative can go to the art director for resolution. The art director can not take sides with the team. He will side with the client.

## Technology is advancing for us to use it. Not just to gain our mutual admiration.

Use whatever latest tools are at our disposal. If a creative software company deploys any new tools and we aren’t using it, we should be ashamed to call ourselves a creative agency.

## There will be lesser rework if you understand for whom you are designing.

An understanding is required of who the client is and what he does. If you don’t know this- ASK. Don’t presume and continue down a dark path repeatedly making mistakes. That costs the company. This applies to both the copywriter and the designer.

## Lastly, quality matters.

Either do it right or don’t do it at all. Don’t make shabby creatives. They are also part of your portfolio even if you don’t add them to your resume.

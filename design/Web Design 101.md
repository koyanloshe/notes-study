# Web Design 101

Three fragments of the web design process.
* Visual design
* Web design
* Design process

## Gestalt theory

*A structure, configuration, or pattern of physical, biological, or psychological phenomena so integrated as to constitute a functional unit with properties not derivable by summation of its parts*

1. **Emergence**
2. **Reification**
3. **Multi-stability**
4. **Invariance**

Emergence says that we attempt to make sense of the whole before we start identifying parts. It means stick to the familiar and recognisable patterns. We begin with the whole and then zoom into the parts. That means that you can get creative with individual form elements as long as the whole thing is immediately recognisable as a form.

Reification says that our minds fill in gaps in visual information in order to identify objects. That means that you don’t have to see entirety of something to understand what it is, though the simpler or widely recognised the whole object is, the easier it’ll be to recognise it by a part.

Multi-stability explains why you can see negative spaces or the positive spaces but never both at the same time. 

Invariance says that we’re really good at recognising similarities and differences. That means it is really easy to make something stand out of a crowd of similar objects.

**Law of simplicity**
Our eyes look for simpler patterns

**Principle of closure**
*When we see a complex arrangement, we look for a single, recognisable pattern*

Closure is basically what makes a minimal logo work.

**Symmetry and order**
Why a 3 column design has become a rage, why there is now a standard for beauty in faces? Symmetry is satisfying.

**Figure/ground**
People see objects as either figure (the focal point) or ground (background)

**Uniform connectedness**
We see elements that are visually connected as more related than elements with no connection

**Common regions**
We see elements as part of a group if they’re enclosed within the same region.

The principle of common regions helps us connect headline, body copy, and image into a story.

**Proximity**
We see objects that are close to each other as more related than objects that are far apart

Proximity helps us keep the complex relationships at play in this image straight.

**Continuation**
We see elements that are on a line or curve as more related than elements that aren’t on the line or curve.

**Common fate**
We see elements that move in the same direction as more related than elements that are stationary or move in different directions

**Parallelism**
We see parallel elements as more related than non parallel elements

**Similarity**

We see elements that share characteristic as more related than those that dont

The circular icon helps us understand that the two Site Design posts are related (i.e., the same type of post).

**Focal points**

Points of interest, emphasis, or difference capture and hold our attention

Dramatic color changes, dramatic size changes, typographic emphasis, dramatic whitespace are examples of focal points.

**Past experiences**
We perceive things in terms of our past experiences

## Color theory

COLOURCODE / Adobe Color CC/ Design Seeds/COLOURLovers/ Dribbble/ Behance

* Monochrome (shades and tints of the same hue)
* Complementary (shades and tints of two hues that are 180 degree opposite to each other)
* Analogous (three colors that sit next to each other in the wheel)
* Triadic (equilateral triangle)

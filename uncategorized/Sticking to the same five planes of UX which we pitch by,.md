Sticking to the same five planes of UX which we pitch by,

**Strategy: site objectives, user objectives**

* From the client we take expectations from his site. Not content pieces but what he would need the site for and what he has in mind with the workings of the site and so on. 
* We set the user objectives for the site. We inform the client that based on our research, we believe 1,2,3,4 are the content pieces required on the site. 
* If he insists on any ddition, _we hold our line_ and deliberate with them if we believe his addition will be of any use to the user or the client himself. 
* Only if it is helpful to either user or client do we accept the change. Pacifying the egos of the clients can come at a later stage in the process. Don't start at this stage. Else we inform him it will be disregarded. 
* _We maintain our status as the experts_

**Scope: functional specs, content requirements**

* We then ask them what CMS they want, what features they want, what kind of special effects they need and so on. 
* We ask them to send us whatever content pieces they have made for different occasions. 
* _We define the full and final scope of our website project here with the client. _
* _Sale closes around this phase. Half of the projects amount is received. _**
**

**Structure: Interaction design, information architecture**

* Before we begin with photoshop, we suggest on email the folds that we plan to put into the website. 
* If we are confident what the client would say or if client is not too involved in the project do we skip this step. 
* _A page wise structure is set. Approvals are taken on structure. _

_Timeframe:_ not more than 2 days on our side. Estimated as 5 days from client side

**Skeleton: Interface design, navigation design and information design/wire framing **

* We strip tit bits of content and put together a working mock.
* Designer will make a mock with imagery of home page and initiate to gauge the look and feel. On approval of look and feel, other pages will be made. 
* Designer will then make additions and subtractions to the design as per client feedback.
* Client will be informed that we will not do changes once in code phase. 
* Mocks will be presented as invision links. 
* Even carousel banners will be sent in the mock. 
* _Mock & changes in photoshop, no reworks in code. Do a great job with the code._

_Timeframe: _all iterations inclusive not more than 14 days (assuming 2 sets of changes - 2 days for us 5 days for client to come back). 

**Surface: visual design**
* Based on email approved Invision mocks, a coded version of the site will be staged on staging.aandb.xyz
* Feedback will be obtained at animation and interaction level. 
* Rebuke the client for structural and cosmetic changes, however small they are. Express that it is inappropriate. Say it isn't convenient and may appear easy to them but comes at a cost to us. 
* _Site on Production server will go live. After this, second half of payment is received. _

_
_
_Timeframe:_ Website will be coded in 2 weeks. 
(Assuming here that even after the client is told no changes, there will come changes and content updates in this phase.)

Needless to say, the project is considered closed only once final payment is received.

## Why these timeframes & why does it matter?

Anything more than this timeline and the overtime begins to count.  

Assuming an average project value of 60k. 

At least 3 people are involved if not more. 

Each person has spent some time out of 35 days after closure of sale on this project either on call, in discussions internally, on photoshop or on code. 

Cost of 3 people's some time = cost of 1 person full time (approximation) 

Estimating this 1 person's salary at ₹33k a month on average ie (25 + 40 + 40)/3 or (25+40)/2

Either way it's 33k a month spent on salary alone. 

Thus 39k is sheer salary cost of a project that goes on for 35 days, excluding overheads and opportunity cost. 

Anything beyond this timeframe and we will have to rush ourselves to deliver faster to prevent it being a project done at actuals or in loss. 

Loss making projects so far - 
1. Grange (3.5 months- 2 people paid 40k have spent at least 2 weeks each on the project so far.)
2. City of Music (2 months - quoted at 2.5L out of which 15k to Ashish, 1. 2L to go to Alchemist. Revenue = 1.3L. Time spent on development side 2 months by 2 people on and off. This implies project's worth matches or is less than revenue earned.)

Sticking to the same five planes of UX which we should pitch by, and are taught at Harvard:

_Strategy: site objectives, user objectives_

* From the client we take expectations from his site. Not content text but what he would need the site for and what he has in mind with the workings of the site and so on. 
* We set the user objectives for the site. We inform the client that based on our research, we believe 1,2,3,4 are the content pieces required on the site. 
* If he insists on any ddition, we hold our line and deliberate with them if we believe his addition will be of any use to the user or the client himself. 
* Only if it is helpful to either user or client do we accept the change. Pacifying the egos of the clients can come at a later stage in the process. Don't start at this stage. Else we inform him it will be disregarded. 
* **We maintain our status as the experts**

_Scope: functional specs, content requirements_

* We then ask them what CMS they want, what features they want, what kind of special effects they need and so on. 
* We ask them to send us whatever content pieces they have made for different occasions. 
* We define the full and final scope of our website project here with the client on an email.

It would look something like below: 
The plan for Decoding Startups microsite is:
* A landing page with a cover to showcase book, a brief caption, the quotes of readers, links to the online and offline stores at which the book is available.
* A microsite for Anis which has 5 folds - 
* A cover with an intro line with the author’s photo
* A little about the author and his roots
* Reputed readers’ quotes
* Showcase of the books written and the shopping sites they are available on
* Contact details of the author &/or his manager

Content blocks will be provided at time of design. Will need the content to be filled into those blocks and provided to us.

These sites will be mobile responsive and backward compatible till IE9. They will be static sites.

We can enable tracking of traffic sent to different websites etc if that is required. It will help.

If there are to be changes in the future to these sites, and if the changes do not involve structural changes, they will come at no extra cost. Every structural change to the site will come at an added cost which can be evaluated per instance.

We will host the sites. There is no additional charge for hosting.

The total budget for this project would be ₹20k + S.T . It will take about 7 business days to design & develop (time taken to approve mocks not accounted for).

* **Sale closes around this phase. Half of the projects amount is received. Number of iterations in design and html will be defined with this scope. **

_Structure: Interaction design, information architecture_

* Before we begin with photoshop, we suggest on email the folds that we plan to put into the website. 
* If we are confident what the client would say or if client is not too involved in the project do we skip this step. 
* **A page wise structure is set. Approvals are taken on structure. **

Timeframe: not more than 2 days on our side. Estimated as 5 days from client side

_Skeleton: Interface design, navigation design and information design/wire framing _

* We strip tit bits of content and put together a working mock.
* Designer will make a mock with imagery of home page and initiate to gauge the look and feel. On approval of look and feel, other pages will be made. 
* Designer will then make additions and subtractions to the design as per client feedback.
* Client will be informed that we will not do changes once in code phase. 
* Mocks will be presented as invision links. 
* Even carousel banners will be sent in the mock. 
* **Mock & changes in photoshop/invision, no reworks in code. Do a great job with the code. **

Timeframe: all iterations inclusive not more than 14 days (assuming 2 sets of changes - 2 days for us 5 days for client to come back). 

_Surface: visual design_

* Based on email approved Invision mocks, a coded version of the site will be _staged_ on staging.aandb.xyz which is our staging server. 
* Feedback to be obtained is at animation and interaction level. 
* Rebuke the client for structural and cosmetic changes, however small they are. Express that it is inappropriate. Say it isn't convenient and may appear easy to them but comes at a cost to us. 
* HTML changes will be at maximum as many as defined in initial scope. 
* **Site will go on production server and will go live. After this, second half of payment is received. **

Timeframe: Website will be coded in 2 weeks. 
(Assuming here that even after the client is told no changes, there will come changes and content updates in this phase.)

Needless to say, the project is considered closed only once final payment is received.

There was a section about cost here which has been deleted.

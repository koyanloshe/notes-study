# Gyan on Management

1. Time Management
Supervisory positions can be very stressful and overwhelming when specific deadlines need to be met. Leaders need to be able to handle tasks and assignments in a timely manner. Time is similar to finances and both need to be budgeted wisely.
2. Communication Skills 
Communication is fundamental in any aspect of life, especially for management teams and among employee relations. Supervisors need to be capable of communicating clearly with fellow managers, employees, other businesses, and customers. Confidence and personality plays a major role in a manager's ability to communicate. Managers should be experienced with speaking both to groups and individuals.
3. Conflict Resolution 
Conflict occurs just about everyday in personal and career based environments. Managers need to be able to listen, identify an issue, agree on the issue, discuss solutions, agree on the solution, and follow up. Conflict between employees may cause awkward tension within _the office_ which can result in slacking or bitterness. Employees should feel comfortable approaching managers regarding conflict and confident that a resolution will be found. Managers will also need to be able to resolve conflict with customers when the time arises. Often clients will become frustrated if something goes wrong and managers need to be able to handle the situation appropriately. It's also important for a follow up check to ensure there are no further problems.
4. Personal Traits 
The business industry expects a lot from managers and personality traits are a major aspect. Managers need to be creative, adaptable, charismatic, understanding, confident, mentally stable, tolerate stress well, great listener, and willingness to learn. Management positions are not easy to fill because of all the key qualities necessary and not everyone will possess all of them. I firmly believe certain personality traits are one of the most important aspects required to run a successful organization.
5. Experience 
Let's face it, not every manager has previous supervisory experience. Generally each manager wasn't immediately promoted to their position and had to climb their way up the totem pole. Many companies overlook potential managers because they don't have previous leadership experience. Experience should be based off their knowledge of their job title, how many years they have worked in their field, and performance appraisals. Experience is something every employer looks at regardless of what position and it's important for people to realize sometimes they have to start lower than expected in order to earn their position.
6. Goal Setting 
Goal setting goes hand-in-hand with time management. Managers need to manage their time wisely and focus on specific goals. Managers also need to be able to assign certain tasks to employees by giving them a goal as well.
7. Responsibility 
Being responsible in the workplace is very important. Managers need to ensure assignments, tasks, and deadlines are met. It's also the responsibility of a manager to hire appropriate people for specific positions. Managers are expected to be able to handle a lot and being responsible about every situation will be beneficial in the end.
8. Organization 
Managers need to be well organized for many different reasons and in many different areas. Keeping a clean and well organized office will impress others and also make it easier to work. Managers need to encourage employees to also keep their personal space clean and neat. Organizing projects, assignments, and documents is a great way to find them quickly and with ease.
9. Leadership Skills 
Managers are leaders in the workplace and need to possess the basic skills. Generally managers were once leaders in other aspects of their life. They might have led youth groups, school projects, plays, and other groups. Being able to handle a group of people and lead them in the right direction is very important.
10. Objective Views 
Managers need to remain objective towards their employees, fellow managers, customers, and their own personal work. A manager should not be bias towards a certain group or person. He/she should always remain non-judgmental and give everyone a chance to prove themselves. Having a "favorite" employee should not happen because it's not fair to other employees. Managers should also be able to remember that you should view staff members and customers in a professional manner rather than as a close personal friend.
